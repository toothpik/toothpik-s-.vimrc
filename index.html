switching from directv to u-verse -- seems as if i'm changing my ISP -- does that mean i'm losing my web-page?<br>
<br>
yes it does -- most people you'll talk to at at&amp;t have never even heard of web hosting -- if you talk to enough<br>
you will eventually be told it is not a service u-verse provides<br>

well, i am on u-verse, and i still seem to have access to the site, so maybe they support web hosting and don't<br>
know it -- will wonders never cease<br>

now they are telling me for sure they are going to shut me down as of July 15, so we sit and watch as they<br>
discontinue services -- first usenet, now web hosting -- what's next?<br>
