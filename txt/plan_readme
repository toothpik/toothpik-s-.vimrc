to create a new plan first edit txt/plan_core with 'noexpandtab' --
there are 3 fields per line separated with tab characters
field 1:  the day of month the transaction is expected to be dealt with
field 2:  the description of the transaction
field 3:  the amount of the transaction

~/tcl/plannew was written to read plan_core and generate a new
plan -- it requires a year on the commandline, so

    ~/tcl$ ./plannew 2011

will print a new plan for 2011 on stdout -- redirect it to a file
when you are happy with how it looks

there is now a txt/plan_core_other documenting the semis, quarterlies
and yearlies

and tcl/plannew has been enhanced to start months on the 23rd of the
preceding month
