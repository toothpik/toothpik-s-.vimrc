the plan modules have a very specific format with column numbers
assigned for fields that cannot stray -- the 1-based column numbers
for each field are described below

 field   colnos   desc
  1       1-5     date transaction created
  2       7-9     type (u = usbank trans, dc = debit card, a = automatic, nnn = checkno)
  3       11-40   description -- for more room create a note entry
  4       42-43   requested clear date for usbank trans
  5       45-46   actual clear date
  6       48-57   trans amount -- income shows as negative
  7       60      past or future -- 'x' means past, blank means future
  8       62-70   balance amount
          72 and beyond can be used for reconciliation amount and date
